1.  Create a make file to hold crucial shell calls to setup the project easily
2.  Create a database schema ----- to me that would be after a system design and application requirement/user stories have been created
3.  Using migration files, create a database schema ---used go migrate
4.  Setup a docker postgres container, connect it and visualize using the psql console, or using table plus
5.  Run migrations to setup the database tables on the postgres server.
6.  Install SQLC, then write tests for the functions generated.... if you ask me, no need for that
7.
